  "description": "Coder Code Server is an open-source project that enables you to run Visual Studio Code (VS Code) on a remote machine, such as a desktop PC or virtual server. It serves a web-based version of VS Code that you can access from any browser via a URL, allowing remote development without needing an SSH connection. Unlike the official VS Code Server used by vscode.dev for Remote Tunnels, code-server is developed by Coder and operates independently, providing similar capabilities through a self-hosted solution.",
